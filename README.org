#+TITLE: ox-whatsapp

A simple WhatsApp markup exporter for org mode.

This exporter is derived from the ASCII exporter which comes with
org-mode. It behaves exactly like that exporter except in cases where
that differs from the [[https://faq.whatsapp.com/539178204879377][markup supported by WhatsApp]].

By default, you can access it in the export dispatcher under the ~w~
key, itself under the ~t~ menu.
